This project was developed using Angular CLI version 19.2.12.

It is a basic, unfinished e-commerce application featuring:

ðŸ›’ Purchase Page
Dynamic stock indicator (only indicates whether stock is available; the stock count does not decrease when items are "purchased").

Product display module: includes picture, description, and price.

Header with links to the cart and homepage.

"About Us" section (currently just text, not linked or scrollable).

ðŸ§º Cart Page
All items are displayed as a list of blocks.

You cannot add items that are out of stock.

Supports adding/removing multiple items.

Includes a purchase summary.

## Development server

To start a local development server you need first to install angular throught npm, then run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
